# GreenFuture-BioChem-Enterprise-Analytics-Case-Study

This repository contains the complete analytics workflow, code, and written report for the GreenFuture BioChem enterprise case study. The project integrates five enterprise datasets—R&amp;D Pipeline, Sales Pipeline, Manufacturing, Procurement, and Product Master—to uncover insights across innovation, operations, demand, and sustainability.

The analysis applies descriptive analytics, diagnostic modeling, and business intelligence techniques to evaluate cost drivers, production efficiency, demand concentration, supplier emissions, and strategic opportunities for GreenFuture’s global operations.

Project Overview:
GreenFuture BioChem is a global bio-based chemicals manufacturer exploring how to strengthen its innovation pipeline, reduce operational inefficiencies, and align procurement decisions with sustainability goals. This project analyzes over 10,000+ data points across CRM and ERP systems to answer three central questions:
Profitability Drivers — Which projects, SKUs, and plants generate the strongest returns or cost efficiencies?
Operational Inefficiencies — Where do bottlenecks, yield losses, and cost variances arise across the value chain?
Sustainability Alignment — How do supplier emissions, R&D priorities, and production outputs align with the company’s low-carbon mission?
The final report integrates statistical summaries, visual diagnostics, and strategic recommendations.

Methods & Techniques:
- Multi-dataset integration and cleaning
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Yield variance & cost variance diagnostics
- Portfolio concentration analysis
- KPI extraction & operational benchmarking
- Visualization (matplotlib, seaborn)
- LaTeX report compilation

Key Insights (Summary)
- Some results highlighted in the report: Production yields across five plants average 92.6%, indicating globally stable manufacturing systems.
- Cost variance is driven primarily by supplier-side price volatility, not operational inefficiency.
- Demand is concentrated in a few product families, with the top 10 SKUs generating nearly 60% of engagement.
- Supplier-level emissions are highly skewed, suggesting targeted decarbonization opportunities.
- R&D and Sales pipelines are well-synchronized, showing efficient innovation throughput.
